# LOGEL
Inverse Reinforcement Learning from a Gradient-based Learner

Code of the paper "Inverse Reinforcement Learning from a Gradient-based Learner", that will be presented at NEURIPS2020.

This repository contains the implementation of the LOGEL algorithm and experiments in simulated domains, together with implementation of SotA baselines we used to confront our results.
